## **Getting Started**

### **Installation and Setup**
Visit this link for a detailed guide on installing and setting up Python - [Python Installation and Setup](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

### **Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks**
Jupyter Notebook is widely used for interactive programming. You can learn how to set it up [here](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/).

## **Data Science Libraries**
Familiarize yourself with these essential Python libraries for data analysis:
- **Numpy**: [Introduction to Numpy](https://github.com/swethankreddy/AI-ArtFusion/blob/main/Week%201/Content/numpy.ipynb)
- **Pandas**: [Introduction to Pandas](https://github.com/swethankreddy/AI-ArtFusion/blob/main/Week%201/Content/pandas.ipynb)
- **Matplotlib**: Useful for data visualization; see [this notebook](https://github.com/swethankreddy/AI-ArtFusion/blob/main/Week%201/Content/Matplotlib.ipynb).

## **Introduction to Data Types and Data Structures**
Learn about the following data types and structures, which are fundamental in Python:
- **Strings**: [Learn about Strings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-strings/?ref=lbp)
- **Lists**: [Learn about Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/?ref=lbp)
- **Dictionaries**: [Learn about Dictionaries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/?ref=lbp)

## **Operators in Python**
Understanding operators is crucial for manipulating data:
- Check out [Python Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-operators/?ref=lbp) for a detailed overview.
  
## **Functions**
Functions are essential for structuring code. Learn about them in [this notebook](https://github.com/swethankreddy/AI-ArtFusion/blob/main/Week%201/Content/Classes.ipynb).

## **Conditions and Loops**
These concepts are core to programming. Learn more about [Conditions](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Conditions) and [Loops](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops).

## **Classes and Objects**
Understand the basics of object-oriented programming. Visit [this notebook](https://github.com/swethankreddy/AI-ArtFusion/blob/main/Week%201/Content/Classes.ipynb) for a detailed explanation.

## **Introduction to Machine Learning**
